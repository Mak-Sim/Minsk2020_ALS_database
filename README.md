## Database
Voice database was collected in Republican Research and Clinical Center of Neurology and Neurosurgery (Minsk, Belarus). It consists of 128 sustained vowel phonations (64 of vowel /a/ and 64 of vowel /i/) from 64 speakers, 31 of which were diagnosed with ALS. Each speaker was asked to produce sustained phonation of vowels /a/ and /i/ at a comfortable pitch and loudness as constant and long as possible. It can be seen that voice database is almost balanced and contains 48\% of pathological voices and 52\% of healthy voices.

The age of the 17 male patients ranges from 40 to 69 (mean 61.1 ± 7.7) and the age of the 14 female patients ranges from 39 to 70 (mean 57.3 ± 7.8). For the case of healthy controls (HC), the age of the 13 men ranges from 34 to 80 (mean 50.2 ± 13.8) and the age of the 20 females ranges from 37 to 68 (mean 56.1 ± 9.7). The samples were recorded at 44.1 kHz using different smartphones with a regular headsets and stored as 16 bit uncompressed PCM files. Average duration of the records in the HC group was 3.7 ± 1.5 s, and in ALS group 4.1 ± 2.0 s. The detailed information about ALS patients is presented in the [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07347).
